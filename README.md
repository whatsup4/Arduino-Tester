To run the "grader"


Our plan was to:


1. Implement the functions/methods students use in our own C++ classes/files
2. Implement "driver" scripts that call setup and loop and check state stored
in our implementations, output results
3. Script doing this over all handins



For students:
1. Web server that runs 1 and 2 with submitted student code and responds with results
2. Probably should have either (a) on the internal network IP or (b) light
authentication for students

Another option:
1. Have a computer/place they can go to with a thumb drive, put the file
somewhere and run a command to check it.
